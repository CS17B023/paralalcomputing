Question2
Compiling: 
mpic++ -Wall -o a.out nqueens.c
mpirun -np <num processors> ./a.out <n>


 Description: Program takes in the size of the board
   as an n value, MPI is initialized and loops from 
   rank to factorial(n) incrementing by size each iteration.
   Inside the loop the i-th permutation of a sorted array of 
   incrementing integers is calculated and a check is done 
   to make sure that no 'queen' is on any diagonal. If any of 
   the checks fail, then that iteration short-circuits and 
   checks the next iteration. If the loop reaches the end, 
   then the counter is incremented. The time of execution and 
   number of solutions found are then output.
